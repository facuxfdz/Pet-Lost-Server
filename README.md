## Git workflow recomendations

- First create a fork clicking on "fork" button  
- Clone your fork repo in local  
  `git clone <remote link>`
- Rename the remote repo reference  
  `git remote rename <old> <new>`  
- Add the original remote repo  
  `git remote add origin <remote link>`
- Create a branch in the fork repo, work in it and make push in the fork
  `git checkout -b <new branch name>`  
- When everything is ready, make pull request from the actual branch and wait for the owner's feedback
